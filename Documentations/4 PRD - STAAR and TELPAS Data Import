0. Jobs to be done
User Story
•	When we receive STAAR and TELPAS results from TEA, I want to import them into the system with as little effort as possible so that the data can be used by staff to make decisions about students.
o	Expected outcome: Minimize the amount of time to bring data into the system.
o	Expected outcome: Reduce manual entry of data in the system.
o	Expected outcome: Increase reliability of data accuracy in system while managing multiple possible entry points.

Jobs Collateral (e.g. interview, sketch, workflow)
•	Story Deck (PowerPoint Deck)
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) requires students to take the STAAR test each year.  In addition, all students classified as 1 - LEP (Limited English Proficient) must take the TELPAS assessment.  When results are returned to the district, they are used for a variety of purposes including consideration for exit for students with Limited English Proficiency.

Current Behavior
•	The system supports the addition of assessment records through the following methods:
•	Integration
•	Data Import
•	Manual Addition
•	Addition of data:
•	When data is added via an integration, the system wipes and replaces all data (including manually added data) [Note: this implies that the SIS is the single source of truth for data]
•	Data Import
•	The Data Import specification allows a user to define a delimited file definition [Note: this requires that users transform the .dat file into an accepted delimited file type]
•	Current Pain Points and Workarounds:
•	Users take screenshots of Eduphoria assessment results and paste them into the rich text field to include the data for review
•	Users who manually enter data "lose their work" when an integration sync occurs
•	Administrative users must manually reformat the .dat file into a supported file format; this is a cumbersome step and often is a point of failure for many districts; where this is the case, teachers may be enlisted to manually add data

How might we address the “job”? Possible Solutions
•	Automated integration with TAMS
•	Support import of raw data (.dat file and .xls file types)
•	Integration with third party vendors (e.g. Eduphoria, SIS Vendors)

Solution Approach:
Automated integration with TAMS is unlikely and integration with third party vendors will require managing various integration points.  For now, adding the ability to do a direct upload of the raw data file seems to be the most valuable solution that will benefit all districts while reducing the amount of work needed to bring data into the system.

Success Criteria
Solution Approach
•	The system shall support the addition of assessment records through the following methods:
•	Integration (Current)
•	Data Import v1 (Current)
•	Data Import v2 (.dat file) New
•	Manual addition (Current)

Create Data Import v2 to support 2017 STAAR 3-8 Testing .dat file
•	The system shall provide an interface for the user to upload a .dat file consistent with the STAAR .dat file
•	The system shall import the .dat file
•	The system shall pull the following fields from the .dat file:
•	Student Identifier (to match eStar record) - (74-82) 9 Characters – Student-ID (Note: this is the same ID as is used for PEIMS.  There is an optional local-student-id field located later in the file as well but may not be as reliable of a source of data).
•	Grade – (5-6) 2 Characters – Grade Level Tested
•	Test Year – (1-4) 4 Characters – Administration Date (0317 = March 2017)
•	Month – (1-4) 4 Characters – Administration Date (0317 = March 2017)
•	Day – Leave blank since day is not available in .dat file format.
•	Subject
	Note, in eStar, the data model is 1 assessment record to 1 subject.  As such, the system will need to transform the data from one row of data into several records for each available subject score.
	Reading: Add record if (351-351) has a value of S (for “score”).
	Mathematics: Add record if (352-352) has a value of S.
	Writing: Add record if (353-353) has a value of S.
	Social Studies: Add record if (354-354) has a value of S.
	Science: Add record if (355-355) has a value of S.
•	Test Language:

	Social Studies: 1515-1515 (E = English)
	Science: 1915-1915 (E = English, S = Spanish)
•	Test Type
	For reading (414 – 414) 1 Character – Reading Test Version (S = STAAR) (Note: this may not map to the custom values in the system.).  Additionally, (415-415) 1 Character – Reading Test Administration Mode indicates O = Online test administration and P = Paper test administration)
	Mathematics: 768-768 AND 769-769 (O = Online test administration, P = Paper test administration)
	Writing: 1114-1114 AND 1115-1115 (O = Online test administration, P = Paper test administration)

Create Data Import v2 to support 2017 TELPAS Testing .dat file
•	The system shall provide an interface for the user to upload a .dat file consistent with the TELPAS .dat file
•	The system shall import the .dat file
•	The system shall pull the following fields from the .dat file:
•	Student Identifier (to match eStar record)
•	(1-4) 4 characters – Administration date (0316 = Spring 2016)(MISSING)
•	(5-6) 2 characters – Grade Level Code (0K = K, 01 = 01, etc.)
•	(74-82) 9 characters – Student ID
•	(201-201) 1 character – General Reading Accommodations (1 = Yes, 0 = No)(MISSING)
•	(202-202) 1 character – Large Print (1 = Yes, 0 = No)(MISSING)
•	(230-230) 1 character – Plan-Year TELPAS Composite Rating (0 = No Rating Available, 1 = Beginning, 2 = Intermediate, 3 = Advanced, 4 = Advanced High)(MISSING)
•	(233-233) 1 character – Listening Proficiency Rating (0 = No Rating Available, 1 = Beginning, 2 = Intermediate, 3 = Advanced, 4 = Advanced High)
•	(248-248) 1 character – Speaking Proficiency Rating (0 = No Rating Available, 1 = Beginning, 2 = Intermediate, 3 = Advanced, 4 = Advanced High)
•	(261-261) 1 character – Writing Proficiency Rating (0 = No Rating Available, 1 = Beginning, 2 = Intermediate, 3 = Advanced, 4 = Advanced High)
•	(276-276) 1 character – Reading Proficiency Rating (0 = No Rating Available, 1 = Beginning, 2 = Intermediate, 3 = Advanced, 4 = Advanced High)

•	(630-630) 1 character – TELPAS Composite Rating (0 = No Rating Available, 1 = Beginning, 2 = Intermediate, 3 = Advanced, 4 = Advanced High)

Adding Records
•	A duplicate is defined as two records with the same student, same test, same year, same subject, same window, same scale score
•	An 'update' record is defined as two records with the same student, same test, same year, same subject, same window, different score or different score code
•	When the system attempts to add a new record, the system shall check to determine if the record is a duplicate or an 'update'
•	If the record is a duplicate, the system shall skip the record and log an error
•	If the record is an 'update', the system shall update the record with the latest data
•	If a user has manually entered a duplicate record, the system shall display an error in the interface
•	If the record is unique, the system shall add the record to the student's record (note: this should be made available to all products - ARD, 504, RTI, LPAC etc.)

Editing Existing Records
•	The system shall allow a user to manually edit an existing record, regardless of its origin (e.g. integration, data import v1, data import v2, manual addition)
•	When an existing record is edited, the system shall save the new record
•	If an integration or data import is performed after the record is edited, the system shall follow the logic stated above (in the event that the record is considered an 'update', the system shall update the record)

Support Maintainable Changes in Data Import Capability
Note: Each year, the .dat file is likely to change.  The design of the system should account for this known variation.  For example, providing an interface for an internal team member to define a data mapping (e.g. Listening Proficiency Rating field is at position 233 to 233, value 0 = No rating available, value 1 = Beginning, value 2 = Intermediate, value 3 = Advanced, value 4 = Advanced High)

State Assessment Screen (? This was an idea suggested at team meeting to implement a State Assessment screen across all products)
•	The system shall provide an interface to view State Assessment scores
•	The system shall display all STAAR records
•	The system shall display all TELPAS records

LPAC Updates
•	If a STAAR record is available for a student, the system shall display it in the STAAR Tests screen as a record
•	If a TELPAS record is available for a student, the system shall display it in the TELPAS Tests screen as a record
•	The system shall automatically pull the STAAR testing data into the EOY screen
•	The system shall automatically pull the TELPAS testing data into the EOY screen
•	The system shall automatically pull the STAAR testing data into the Progress Reports screen
•	The system shall automatically pull the TELPAS testing data into the Progress Reports screen

Non-functional requirements
•	The design of the interface should be flexible to accommodate for yearly changes in file structure
